# Safety, Ethics & Governance

## 1. Overview

Vidhi is designed to assist legal research and document drafting in the Indian legal ecosystem.  
Given the sensitive nature of legal data and decision-making, strict safety, ethical, and governance guidelines must be enforced.

The primary objectives are:

- Prevent misinformation or fabricated legal content  
- Ensure user privacy and data security  
- Maintain human oversight for all outputs  
- Adhere to Indian legal and professional ethical standards

## 2. Safety Principles

### 2.1 Human-in-the-Loop Enforcement
- All outputs generated by Vidhi must be **verified by a qualified legal professional**.  
- Automated drafts or suggestions are **assistive**, not final filings.  

### 2.2 Citation and Source Verification
- Only **verified legal databases and official portals** are ingested.  
- Citations are cross-checked for authenticity.  
- Hallucinated or unverified content is flagged and **not included** in the final output.

### 2.3 Output Monitoring
- Each agent logs interactions for traceability.  
- LLM outputs are validated using **retrieval-augmented methods** to prevent hallucinations.  
- Alerts are raised for inconsistencies or missing information.

### 2.4 Data Privacy & Security
- Sensitive client data is stored only in **secure local or cloud storage**.  
- Access is controlled via authentication and authorization policies.  
- Data retention policies align with **legal confidentiality requirements**.

## 3. Ethical Guidelines

### 3.1 No Legal Advice
- Vidhi **does not provide legal opinions**.  
- Users must understand that outputs are **drafts and research aids only**.  

### 3.2 No Fabrication
- Case facts, precedents, statutes, and citations are **never invented**.  
- If relevant sources are missing, agents return **alerts or gaps**, not assumptions.  

### 3.3 Fair Access
- Tools should be designed to support **litigants, small law firms, and legal researchers**, not just large firms.  

### 3.4 Responsible AI Practices
- LLMs are fine-tuned or prompted to **minimize biases**.  
- Sensitive legal topics are handled with caution.  
- Multilingual outputs respect cultural and legal context.

### 4.1 Policy Rules
- Human verification is mandatory for all outputs.  
- Only authorized users can ingest, query, or export legal data.  
- Audit logs are maintained for all actions within Vidhi.  
- Updates to prompts, vector stores, or agent workflows require **version control and peer review**.

### 4.2 Agent Oversight
- Each agent has **specific responsibilities** to reduce risk:  
  - **CaseFinder:** retrieves precedents from verified sources  
  - **IssueSpotter:** identifies applicable sections accurately  
  - **LimitationChecker:** flags time-bar issues  
  - **ArgumentBuilder:** generates arguments without personal bias  
  - **DocComposer:** drafts with placeholders for human verification  
  - **ComplianceGuard:** validates filings against court rules  
  - **AidConnector:** suggests aid options responsibly

### 4.3 Continuous Evaluation
- Regular evaluation of agent outputs using metrics:  
  - Citation accuracy  
  - Retrieval relevance  
  - Hallucination rate  
  - Latency and completeness  

- Feedback loops allow **prompt adjustments and agent retraining**.

## 5. Incident Management

- Any detected hallucinations, inaccurate citations, or system errors trigger alerts.  
- Administrators review incidents and apply corrective actions.  
- Users are notified if outputs are **partially incomplete or unverifiable**.

---

## 6. Compliance & Audit

- The system maintains **immutable logs** for research, drafting, and compliance checks.  
- All activities can be audited to ensure adherence to legal and ethical standards.  
- Regular reviews of agent workflows and prompts are conducted to **prevent drift**.

## 7. Conclusion

Vidhi integrates **agentic AI workflows** with strong safety, ethical, and governance measures to:

- Reduce human effort in legal research and drafting  
- Ensure all outputs are **traceable, verifiable, and human-reviewed**  
- Provide a responsible, ethical, and secure platform for legal professionals
